# STP / ETP Technology

**Sewage Treatment Plants (STP)** and **Effluent Treatment Plants (ETP)** are the backbone of sustainable water management. While STPs focus on treating domestic sewage, ETPs are designed to handle complex industrial wastewater. At SM Reconcile, we provide customized, end-to-end solutions for both.

## Sewage Treatment Plant (STP)

Sewage treatment removes contaminants from municipal wastewater, mainly from household sewage. The objective is to produce an effluent that is safe for release into the environment or for reuse.

### Treatment Process Stages

1.  **Primary Treatment**: Physical removal of large solids (screening) and suspended matter (sedimentation). Reduces pollutant load by ~30-40%.
2.  **Secondary Treatment**: Biological treatment (using technologies like MBBR, MBR, SBR) to degrade dissolved organic matter. Reduces BOD/COD by ~85-90%.
3.  **Tertiary Treatment**: Final polishing via filtration (Sand/Carbon filters) and disinfection (Chlorination/UV) to make water suitable for reuse in flushing or gardening.

## Effluent Treatment Plant (ETP)

ETPs are critical for industries such as pharmaceuticals, textiles, and chemicals, where wastewater contains toxic chemicals, oils, and heavy metals that cannot be treated by standard STPs.

### Key Components

*   **Equalization Tank**: Balances flow and pollutant concentration.
*   **Physio-Chemical Treatment**: Coagulation, flocculation, and neutralization to remove suspended solids and adjust pH.
*   **Biological Treatment**: Aerobic or anaerobic digestion to break down organic compounds.
*   **Sludge Management**: Dewatering and safe disposal of solid waste generated during treatment.

## Why Choose Our Solutions?

*   **Customization**: We don't believe in "one size fits all." We analyze your specific wastewater profile to design the most efficient system.
*   **Regulatory Compliance**: Our plants are guaranteed to meet the stringent discharge norms set by Pollution Control Boards (PCB) and NGT.
*   **Zero Liquid Discharge (ZLD)**: For water-scarce areas, we offer ZLD solutions that recycle 98% of wastewater, leaving zero discharge.
*   **Smart Automation**: Integration of IoT-based monitoring for real-time tracking of pH, COD, BOD, and flow rates.

## Industries We Serve

*   **Residential Complexes & Townships**
*   **Hospitals & Hotels**
*   **Pharmaceutical & Chemical Industries**
*   **Textile & Dyeing Units**
*   **Food & Beverage Processing**
