# Sewage Treatment Solutions


At **SM Reconcile Environmente Solutions Pvt. Ltd.**, we offer comprehensive, efficient, and cost-effective solutions to tackle sewage and effluent treatment. Our services are designed to bridge the gap between health, sanitation, and the environment, helping communities manage waste sustainably while minimizing the burden on natural ecosystems.


## Our Philosophy

We believe in creating a **circular economy** in sanitation and waste management that promotes the conservation of natural resources like water and fertile soil. Our sewage treatment solutions are:

- **Sustainable**: Focused on reducing ecological strain while ensuring human health and hygiene.
- **Efficient**: Custom-tailored to meet local requirements with minimal operational costs.
- **Resource-Conserving**: We help create a natural abundance of resources like water and fertile sand through innovative waste management.

## Our Services

We specialize in the following sewage treatment technologies:

- **Moving Bed Biofilm Reactor (MBBR)**
- **Membrane Bioreactor (MBR)**
- **Sequencing Batch Reactor (SBR)**
- **Sewage Treatment Plants (STP) / Effluent Treatment Plants (ETP)**

These technologies are engineered to handle sewage treatment efficiently, ensuring that the treated water is safe for reuse in non-potable applications such as toilet flushing, road cleaning, and gardening.

## Sewage Treatment Process

Our sewage treatment process is a three-stage system designed to remove suspended solids and pollutants from wastewater effectively:

### Primary Treatment

In the primary treatment stage, we remove floating debris and insoluble impurities, such as plastic bags, leaves, and twigs. This stage involves:

- **Screening**: Removing coarse solids like rocks, metals, and larger waste.
- **Grit Chamber**: Filtering out finer solids to prepare the water for secondary treatment.

The primary stage results in the removal of **40-50% of solids** from the wastewater.

### Secondary Treatment
The secondary treatment focuses on removing **85-90% of pollutants**. Here, wastewater flows through specialized treatment tanks where **Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD)**, **Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD)**, and **Total Suspended Solids (TSS)** are controlled. This stage encourages the formation of **sludge**, which clumps together and settles out of the water.

### Tertiary Treatment
In the final stage, the clarified water is filtered through:

- A **Pressure Sand Filter (PSF)**
- An **Activated Carbon Filter (ACF)**

This process removes any remaining suspended impurities and a substantial portion of **BOD** and **COD**. The treated water is stored in tanks and is ready for reuse.

## Why Choose Our Solutions?

- **Regulatory Compliance**: Our systems comply with the latest regulations, including the **Supreme Court Order Writ Petition (No. 375 of 2012)**, which mandates that all industrial units have fully operational primary effluent treatment plants.
  
- **Proven Efficiency**: With our **thumb rule** approach, expect:
  - **30% reduction** in pollutants after primary treatment
  - **65% reduction** after secondary treatment
  - **5% reduction** after tertiary treatment

- **Environmental Benefits**: By choosing our sewage treatment solutions, you actively contribute to protecting groundwater from contamination and ensure a healthier ecosystem.

## Challenges in Sewage Treatment

Despite advancements in sewage treatment, certain challenges remain, including:

- **Design Faults**: Inflow of sewage exceeding treatment capacity.
- **Odor Issues**: Inadequate aeration or faulty design can lead to foul smells.
- **Overflow and Malfunction**: Poor sensor management or electrical issues can disrupt the system.

Our team of experts works diligently to overcome these challenges, ensuring seamless operation and minimal disruption to your facility.
