# SBR Technology (Sequencing Batch Reactor)

**Sequencing Batch Reactor (SBR)** is a variation of the activated sludge process where all treatment steps—filling, aeration, settling, and decanting—take place sequentially in the same tank. This "fill-and-draw" system offers great flexibility and control over the treatment process.

## How It Works

The SBR process operates in a cycle of five steps:
1.  **Fill**: Wastewater enters the tank, mixing with the biomass.
2.  **React**: Aeration begins, allowing bacteria to consume organic pollutants.
3.  **Settle**: Aeration stops, and sludge settles to the bottom, leaving clear water on top.
4.  **Decant**: The clear, treated water is removed from the tank.
5.  **Idle**: The tank waits for the next cycle to begin; sludge wasting may occur here.

## Key Advantages

*   **Process Flexibility**: Cycle times can be adjusted to handle varying flow rates and organic loads, making it ideal for industries with fluctuating wastewater generation.
*   **Nutrient Removal**: By controlling aeration (creating aerobic and anoxic phases), SBRs are highly effective at removing nitrogen and phosphorus.
*   **Small Footprint**: Since equalization, aeration, and sedimentation occur in one tank, it eliminates the need for separate clarifiers.
*   **Cost-Effective**: Reduced civil construction and mechanical equipment requirements often lead to lower capital costs.

## Applications

*   Municipal wastewater treatment for small to medium-sized communities.
*   Industrial wastewater with variable flow or composition.
*   Hotels, resorts, and educational institutions.

## Technology Comparison

While SBR is a powerful technology, comparing it with MBR helps in selecting the right fit:
